<h2>Docker</h2>
<p>is container based technology and containers are just user space of the operating system. At the low level,
a container is just a set of processes that are isolated from the rest of the system, running from a distinct image 
that provides all files necessary to support the processes. It is built for running applications. In Docker, the containers running share the host OS kernel.</p>
