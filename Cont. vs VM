<h2>Docker</h2>
<p>is container based technology and containers are just user space of the operating system. At the low level,
a container is just a set of processes that are isolated from the rest of the system, running from a distinct image 
that provides all files necessary to support the processes. It is built for running applications. In Docker, the containers running share the host OS kernel.</p>
<h2>Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>A Virtual Machine, on the other hand, is not based on container technology. They are made up of user space plus
kernel space of an operating system. Under VMs, server hardware is virtualized. Each VM has Operating system (OS) 
& apps. It shares hardware resource from the host.</p>
